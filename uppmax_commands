THE BATCH JOB
batch_job.sh:
===========================
#!/bin/bash -1

#SBATCH -A b2013066
#SBATCH -p core [core or node]
#SBATCH -n 1 [number of cores (32 if 2 nodes, 16 if single node, etc)]
#SBATCH -N 1 [number of nodes]
#SBATCH -t 12:00:00
#SBATCH -J some_job_name
--qos=short [if job is expected to be less then 15 minutes]

code...
===========================
Then
sbatch batch_job.sh

Alternatively, specify sbatch parameters on command line:
sbatch \
       --mail-user <email address> \
       -A <project_id> \
        -p node \
	-n <num_cores> \
	-t <days-hours:minutes:seconds> \
	-J <job_name> \
	-e <STDERR output> \
	-o <STDOUT output>
	<job_script> [job_script_argument1] [job_script_argument2] [etc]

MONITORING JOBS
jobinfo
jobinfo -u joranm
squeue

MONITORING RUNNING JOBS
column -t /sw/share/slurm/milou/uppmax_jobstats/<node>/<job_id> | less -S

MONITORING STOPPED JOBS
finishedjobinfo

jobstats -p <jobid>
Gives you a graphical overview of how much memory and processing power the job is using over time. 
Requires graphical ssh connection. 
View the graph with
eog milou-<groupname>-<username>-<jobid>.png

jobstats -p -A <project id>
Shows you a history of jobs run in this project

CANCELING JOBS
scancel <jobid1> <jobid2> <etc>			Kills multiple jobs
scancel -i -u joranm				Kills all commands, but asks if you are really sure for each of them
scancel -u joranm --state=pending	      	Kills all jobs that are currently in queue
scancel -u joranm -n <jobname> -t running	Kills all running jobs with the name [jobname]

NODE INFORMATION
Standard	128GB RAM, 16 cores, -> 8GB RAM per core
Fat		512GB RAM, specify with '-C fat'. There are 17 of these nodes
256		256GB RAM, specify with '-C mem256GB'. There are 17 of these nodes
512		512GB RAM, specify with '-C mem512GB'. There are 17 of these nodes

CPU TIME
1 corehour	-> Running 1 core for one 'wallclock' hour
16 corehours 	-> Running 1 node for one 'wallclock' hour

DISK INFORMATION
Also on Uppmax you have a home and your project folders.
You have about 32 GB available on your home.

RUNNING STUFF ON HALVAN
It is more or less the same but you need to specify that you run on HALVAN.
sbatch \
       -A <project_id> \
       -M halvan \
       -p halvan \
       -n <num_cores> \
       -t <days-hours:minutes:seconds> \
       -J <jobname> \
       <job_script> [arg1] [arg2] [etc]

The number of cores you set decides how much memory you demand from Halvan.
For example, 64 demands exclusive use of Halvan and thus 2048 GB RAM, whereas 32 demands only 1024 GB RAM

GENERAL TIPS
Use "rsync" to transfer files between Uppmax and your machine
